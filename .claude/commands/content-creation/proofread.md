description: Proofread and edit content using Editor Mode with Voice DNA alignment
---

## Step 1: Enter Editor Mode

Read `/context/core/claude-modes.json` and activate **Editor Mode** with all its behavior settings:
- Cut fluff mercilessly
- Challenge every word, sentence, and paragraph
- Tighten prose without losing meaning or voice
- Kill redundancy
- Simplify complex sentences

## Step 2: Load Voice DNA

Read `/context/core/voice-dna.json` and apply Clifton's authentic voice:
- **Tone**: Witty, energetic, educational, inspiring, authoritative yet approachable
- **Humor**: Sarcastic, self-deprecating, observational
- **Signature phrases**: "Here's what nobody tells you...", "Don't use AI as your brain, use it as a tool!"
- **Words to avoid**: Educational jargon, corporate speak, "synergy", "leverage", "paradigm shift", "utilize"
- **Punctuation**: Heavy on exclamation points, no em-dashes

## Step 3: Proofread Content

Review the provided content against:

### Editor Mode Priority Hierarchy
1. **Clarity and readability** — Can the reader understand it immediately?
2. **Conciseness** — Can this be said in fewer words?
3. **Structure and flow** — Does it move logically and smoothly?
4. **Voice consistency** — Does it sound like Clifton, not generic AI?
5. **Grammar and mechanics** — Clean, correct, professional

### Voice Enforcement (Flag or Fix)
- No em dashes (use commas, periods, or parentheses)
- No overused cliches
- No AI-sounding phrases
- No wrap-up cliches ("moving forward", "going forward")
- No flowery language — replace with direct, specific words
- Convert passive voice to active
- Remove filler words (very, really, just, quite, somewhat, actually, basically)

## Step 4: Output

Provide both:
1. **Clean revised version** — ready to use, matching Clifton's voice
2. **Summary of key changes** — what was cut, restructured, or fixed and why

## Step 5: Exit Editor Mode

After completing the proofreading task, exit Editor Mode.
